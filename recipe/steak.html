        <p>This is a beef steak marinade recipe, note: use only economical steak, don't use expensive steak, it would be a waste.</p>
        <p>here is the ingredients :</p>
        <p1><ul>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>economical steak</li>

        </ul>
    
    <p>here is the step for making the steak</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together mustard, garlic and onion powder. Then mix in remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place beef in a ziplock bag with Marinade and marinade overnight (12 - 24 hours).</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature - key for even cooking of steaks. Shake off excess marinade.</li>
            <li>Brush BBQ Grills with oil, then heat on high heat until is really hot - you should see wisps of smoke. Or heat a heavy based skillet on high until very hot, then add oil - it will heat almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Add steaks. For 2cm / 3/4" thick steaks, cook the first side for 2 minutes, then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes (medium rare 52°C/125°F, chart below for other doneness temps). (Note 3)</li>
            <li>Remove from skillet onto a WARM plate, cover loosely with foil and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve! I couldn't resist garlic butter - see recipe in notes.</li>
        </ol>
